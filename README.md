## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation Instructions 
Install: brew tap forshaws/homebrew-oboi  then brew install oboi
Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
brew tap forshaws/homebrew-oboi
brew install oboi
```


Uninstall
Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
brew uninstall oboi
```


## üìß Usage Instructions 

oboi currently supports the "check" command only. 

Example usage commands:

```bash
oboi check --apikey=<yourapikey> joy1@walletx-fakers.net 
```

**note** Replace **<YOUR_API_KEY>** with the supplied one from TORIDION if you have one. **IF** you have no key you can omit the --apikey argument completely and use the free tier **10 per day** like this:

```bash
oboi check joy1@walletx-fakers.net
```


Add JSON return argument
oboi will return the full API result in JSON if you include the --json flag. Example:

```bash
oboi check --json joy1@walletx-fakers.net 
```

**Recommended : Adding your apikey to the env so you dont have to keep entering it**

By adding the apikey to your environment variables you can use oboi without entering a key all the time. If your apikey is set in env, then oboi just uses your api credits.** If no key is set in env or on the command line it will default to free trial mode**. 

Add your key to the env by using the following command:

```bash
export OBOI_APIKEY="YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE"
```

Remove the key using the following command:

```bash
unset OBOI_APIKEY
```
